# 📄 Templates Repository

This repository serves as a **central hub for reusable templates** that can speed up project setup and documentation.
It contains ready-made files for common project needs, such as **README templates, license guides, and more**.

## 📚 What’s Inside

  * Covers permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)
  * Covers copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL, LGPL, MPL)
  * Covers public domain and zero-restriction licenses (CC0, Unlicense)
