### 1. **Apache License 2.0**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: A permissive license, allowing users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, including for commercial purposes.
- **Conditions**: Requires attribution and a copy of the license. Also includes a **patent grant**, protecting users from patent litigation related to the software.
- **Limitation**: It allows for the creation of proprietary software derived from open-source code.

**Key Points**:
- You can include the software in closed-source projects.
- Contributors are protected from legal liability.
- Patent protection is an important feature, as it prevents contributors from suing users for patent infringement based on the software.

**Example Scenario**: You‚Äôre building a framework and want companies to adopt it without fear of patent litigation.

---

### 2. **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: A **strong copyleft** license. Users can use, modify, and distribute the software, but any derivative works must also be licensed under GPL-3.0.
- **Conditions**: You must release the source code of any modified version of the software and license it under the same terms.
- **Limitation**: Any software that uses GPL-licensed code must also be open-sourced. This license also includes **patent protections**.

**Key Points**:
- If you modify GPL-licensed code and distribute it, the modified code must also be released under GPL.
- It prohibits the incorporation of GPL-licensed code into proprietary software.
- This license protects against "Tivoization" (modifying software but preventing users from running modified versions).

**Example Scenario**: You want your project to stay open-source forever, even in modified forms.

---

### 3. **MIT License**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: A very permissive license. Users can do anything with the software: use, modify, and distribute it, even for commercial purposes.
- **Conditions**: The only requirement is attribution (i.e., you must include the original license and author information in any copies of the software).
- **Limitation**: There are no restrictions on how the software is used or redistributed, including combining it with proprietary software.

**Key Points**:
- It is one of the most permissive licenses.
- Often used when you want minimal restrictions on how your software is used.

**Example Scenario**: You created a small JavaScript library and want the widest adoption possible.

---

### 4. **BSD 2-Clause License ("Simplified")**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Permissive license similar to the MIT License.
- **Conditions**: Requires attribution and includes a disclaimer of liability.
- **Limitation**: Allows proprietary modifications and does not require the release of source code.

**Key Points**:
- Suitable for projects that prioritize simplicity and minimal legal restrictions.
- A simpler version of the BSD 3-Clause License (below).

**Example Scenario**: Your university research team wants industry to adopt your code freely.

---

### 5. **BSD 3-Clause License ("Revised" or "New")**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Similar to the BSD 2-Clause License, but with an additional clause.
- **Conditions**: The third clause prevents the use of the project‚Äôs or its contributors‚Äô names for endorsement of derivative works.
- **Limitation**: Slightly more restrictive than the BSD 2-Clause License, but still permissive.

**Key Points**:
- Widely used in open-source projects, such as the FreeBSD operating system.

**Example Scenario**: You want permissive licensing but don‚Äôt want your name used for commercial endorsement.

---

### 6. **Boost Software License 1.0**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Very permissive, similar to MIT and BSD licenses.
- **Conditions**: Requires attribution but no other significant restrictions.
- **Limitation**: Few restrictions, making it suitable for both open-source and proprietary use.

**Key Points**:
- Ideal for libraries and frameworks that aim for maximum adoption.

**Example Scenario**: You‚Äôre releasing a C++ library meant for integration into many products.

---

### 7. **Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0)**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Effectively places the software in the public domain. Users can do anything with the software, including commercial use, without requiring attribution.
- **Conditions**: No conditions; this license waives all copyright and related rights.
- **Limitation**: No liability or warranty provided.

**Key Points**:
- Often used when you want to fully waive all rights over the software.

**Example Scenario**: You want to share a dataset with absolutely no rights reserved.

---

### 8. **Eclipse Public License 2.0**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: A **weak copyleft** license. You can use, modify, and distribute the software, but modifications must be released under EPL.
- **Conditions**: You must release the source code for modifications, but combining with other code does not require making the other code open-source.
- **Limitation**: Modifications must remain open-source, but other parts of the project can remain proprietary.

**Key Points**:
- Popular in enterprise and large-scale open-source projects.

**Example Scenario**: A company shares a plugin framework but allows proprietary extensions.

---

### 9. **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Strong copyleft, similar to GPL-3.0, but includes an additional clause for network use.
- **Conditions**: If you modify the software and use it over a network (e.g., a web application), you must provide the source code to all users who interact with the software.
- **Limitation**: This ensures that even software used as a service (SaaS) remains open-source.

**Key Points**:
- Used in web-based software to ensure that users can access the source code even if they don‚Äôt run the software directly.


**Example Scenario**: You‚Äôre building a collaborative web app and want users to have source access.

---

### 10. **GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0)**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Similar to GPL-3.0, but lacks some of the protections against patents and Tivoization introduced in the later version.
- **Conditions**: If you distribute a modified version of the software, you must release it under GPL-2.0.
- **Limitation**: All derivative works must be open-sourced.

**Key Points**:
- Many legacy open-source projects still use GPL-2.0, but new projects typically opt for GPL-3.0.

**Example Scenario**: You‚Äôre maintaining a legacy open-source project under GPL-2.0.

---

### 11. **GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: A **weak copyleft** license. It allows linking to proprietary software without requiring the proprietary software to be open-sourced.
- **Conditions**: If you modify the LGPL-covered library itself, you must release it under LGPL.
- **Limitation**: Mainly used for libraries to allow them to be incorporated into proprietary software.

**Key Points**:
- Allows for a mix of open-source and proprietary software.

**Example Scenario**: You develop an encryption library you want used in both open and closed-source apps.

---

### 12. **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: A **weak copyleft** license. You can use, modify, and distribute the software. MPL-covered code must remain open-source, but it can be combined with proprietary software.
- **Conditions**: Any changes to MPL-covered files must be made available under MPL, but other files can remain proprietary.
- **Limitation**: Only modifications to MPL-licensed code need to be open-sourced.

**Key Points**:
- Used by large open-source projects like Mozilla Firefox.

**Example Scenario**: You‚Äôre releasing a browser engine but want developers to build proprietary extensions.

---

### 13. **The Unlicense**
**Overview**:
- **Permissions**: Places the software in the public domain, allowing anyone to do anything with the software without restriction.
- **Conditions**: No conditions or restrictions.
- **Limitation**: No liability or warranty provided by the author.

**Key Points**:
- Suitable for developers who want to relinquish all control over their software.

**Example Scenario**: You want to release a script without any legal strings attached.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Use a permissive license (e.g., MIT, BSD)** if you want to allow broad use, including in proprietary projects.
- **Use a copyleft license (e.g., GPL, AGPL)** if you want to ensure that all derivative works remain open-source.
- **Use a weak copyleft license (e.g., MPL, LGPL)** if you want to balance open-source requirements with some flexibility for proprietary use.
- **Use a public domain dedication (e.g., CC0, Unlicense)** if you want to waive all rights over your software.

Each license serves different use cases, so choose one that aligns with your goals for distribution, modification, and collaboration.
